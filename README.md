# Simple Nanoprocessor

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Simple Nanoprocessor created as a project for the Computer Organization and Digital Design course during the second semester at the Computer Science Engineering department. The project was developed by Gunathunga W.S.D. and Guruge S.M.L. using Vivado Xilinx.

## Project Description

The Simple Nanoprocessor is a basic processor design aimed at demonstrating fundamental concepts of computer organization and digital design. It serves as a practical application of the theoretical knowledge gained during the course.

## Features

- **Processor Core:** The repository includes the source code and configuration files for the Simple Nanoprocessor core.
